<h1>Examples of paragraph</h1>
  <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 30px;">Water is the essence of life, a vital resource that sustains every living organism on Earth. Covering approximately 71% of the planet's surface, it exists in oceans, rivers, and glaciers. Beyond hydration, water is crucial for agriculture, sanitation, and industrial processes.</p>
  <p align="justify" style="column-count: 2; column-gap: 45px;">Despite its abundance, only a tiny fraction is freshwater available for human use. Climate change, pollution, and over-exploitation are rapidly depleting these reserves, leading to global water scarcity. Conserving water is no longer an option but a necessity for our survival. By protecting our water sources and reducing waste, we ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.</p>
