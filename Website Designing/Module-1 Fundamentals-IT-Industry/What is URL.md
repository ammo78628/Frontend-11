#What is URL?
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is the specific web address you type into a browser to find a particular page or file on the internet.
Simple Definitions
Digital Address: If the internet is a city, a URL is the exact house address (including the street and flat number).
Direct Link: It tells the browser exactly where to go to find the data you want.
Unique Identity: No two webpages can have the exact same URL at the same time.
How it Works (The Breakdown)
A typical URL looks like this:
https://www.google.com/search-results
Protocol (https://): The "language" used to send data. "S" stands for Secure.
Domain Name (google.com): The name of the website (the "building").
Path (/search-results): The specific "room" or page inside that website.
