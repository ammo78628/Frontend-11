What is Software?
Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. While hardware is the physical body of a computer, software is the "mind" or "soul" that tells it what to do.
Simple Definitions
The Brain: It is the invisible part of the computer that processes information.
Instruction Manual: It tells the hardware (like your screen or keyboard) exactly how to behave.
App/Program: Every application you use, from WhatsApp to VS Code, is a piece of software.
How it Works
Coding: Developers write software using programming languages (like Java, JavaScript, or TypeScript).
Execution: When you "run" a program, the computer's processor reads the software instructions and performs the work.
Storage: Software is stored on your hard drive or SSD but runs in the RAM.


Examples in Your Daily Life
Operating Systems: The Windows 11 running on your PC.
Web Apps: The MERN stack projects you are learning to build.
Utilities: Antivirus programs or disk cleaners
