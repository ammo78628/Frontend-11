#What is SEO?
SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the process of improving your website so that it appears higher up in search results (like Google) when people look for things related to your business or content.
Simple Definitions
Free Traffic: It’s about getting "organic" (unpaid) visitors to your site.
The Competition: Since there are millions of websites, SEO helps yours stand out so Google picks it first.
User Experience: Google likes websites that are fast, easy to use, and have good information.
How it Works
Keywords: The specific words people type into a search bar (e.g., "best earbuds" or "mern stack tutorial").
Crawling: Search engines use "bots" to read your website's code and understand what it's about.
Ranking: Based on how good your SEO is, Google decides if you are on Page 1 or Page 100.
