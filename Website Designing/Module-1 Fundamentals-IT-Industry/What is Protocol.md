#What is a Protocol?
In the world of networking, a Protocol is a set of formal rules that govern how data is exchanged between devices. Think of it as a common language that two computers must speak to understand each other.  
Simple Definitions
The Rulebook: It defines how a conversation starts, how data is sent, and how it ends.
The Agreement: Without protocols, a computer sending a file would be like a person speaking Gujarati to someone who only knows French—they wouldn't be able to communicate.  
Standardization: It ensures that a Mac, a Windows PC, and an Android phone can all talk to the same server.
How it Works
Handshaking: The devices introduce themselves and agree on the rules.  
Formatting: The data is broken into small "packets" with a specific structure.  
Error Checking: The protocol checks if any data was lost or corrupted during the "trip."
