#What is a Responsive Website?
A Responsive Website is a site designed to automatically "respond" or adjust its layout to fit the screen size of any device—whether it’s a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.  
Simple Definitions
One Site, All Devices: You don't need a separate "mobile version" of your site. The same URL works everywhere.  
Flexible Grid: The images and text "flow" like water to fill the available space.  
User-Friendly: It ensures that buttons are easy to click and text is easy to read without zooming in on a phone.  
How it Works
Media Queries: Developers use CSS rules to tell the website, "If the screen is smaller than 600px, stack the columns on top of each other."
Fluid Layouts: Instead of using fixed sizes (like 1000 pixels), it uses percentages (like 100%).  
Breakpoints: Specific points where the design changes (e.g., a 3-column layout on a PC becomes a 1-column layout on a phone).


***Examples***
```Amazon / Flipkart: Notice how the product grid changes from 5 items in a row on your PC to just 1 or 2 on your phone.
Google Search: It looks clean and usable regardless of what device you use.```
