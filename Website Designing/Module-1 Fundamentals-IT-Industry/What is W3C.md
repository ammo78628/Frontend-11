#What is W3C?
W3C stands for the World Wide Web Consortium. It is the international community that creates the "rules" and standards for how the web should be built and how it should work.  
Simple Definitions
The Referees: They don't build websites, but they decide the standards that developers must follow so that websites work the same on all browsers.
Standardization: Without W3C, a website might open perfectly in Chrome but look completely broken in Safari or Firefox.
Founding: It was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the man who actually invented the World Wide Web.  
What does the W3C do?
Develops Languages: They are responsible for the evolution of HTML, CSS, and XML.  
Accessibility: They create guidelines (WCAG) to make sure the internet is usable for people with disabilities.  
Future Tech: They work on new standards for things like Web Payments, Privacy, and Virtual Reality (WebXR).  
Why it Matters for Developers
Validation: Developers use the "W3C Validator" tool to check if their code has any errors according to the official rules.  
Consistency: Following W3C standards ensures your MERN stack or WordPress site is "future-proof" and works on every device.
