#What is Client-Server Architecture?
Client-Server Architecture is a computing model where the workload is divided between two types of participants: the Client (who asks for something) and the Server (who provides it). It is the backbone of almost everything we do on the internet.  
Simple Definitions
The Request-Response Cycle: The client sends a request, and the server sends a response.  
Centralization: The data is usually stored in one central place (the server) so that many different clients can access it.  
Division of Labor: The client handles the "look" (UI), while the server handles the "logic" and "data."  
Key Components
1. The Client (The Requester)
It is the device or software that a person uses to interact with the web.  
Examples: Your web browser (Chrome), a mobile app (Instagram), or a PC.
Role: To display information to the user and collect their input.
2. The Server (The Provider)
It is a powerful computer that "serves" the requested data or services.  
Examples: Web servers (Apache/Nginx), Database servers (MongoDB), or Mail servers.  
Role: To store files, process complex logic, and keep the data secure.  
How it Works (The Steps)
Request: You click a link in your browser (Client) to see a product.
Network: The request travels over the internet via protocols like HTTP.  
Processing: The Server receives the request, checks the database, and finds the product details.  
Response: The server sends the data back to your browser.
Rendering: Your browser displays the product page.
