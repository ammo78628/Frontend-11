#What are LAN, MAN, and WAN?
These terms describe the geographical scale of a computer network. They tell you how much area a network covers—from a single room to the entire planet.
1. LAN (Local Area Network)
Definition: A network that connects computers within a small, limited area.
Range: Usually within a single building, office, or home.
Speed: Very high speed (e.g., Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
Example: Your home Wi-Fi connecting your laptop, phone, and printer.
2. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
Definition: A network that connects multiple LANs across a larger geographic area, like a whole city.
Range: Covers a city or a large campus.
Speed: Moderate to high speed (usually uses fiber optic cables).
Example: A cable TV network in your city or a university campus connecting different departments across town.
3. WAN (Wide Area Network)
Definition: A network that spans a very large distance, such as a country, continent, or the entire world.
Range: Global or national.
Speed: Slower than LAN due to the massive distance data has to travel.
