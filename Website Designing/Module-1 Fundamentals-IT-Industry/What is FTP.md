#What is FTP?
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. Think of it as a digital delivery service that moves files between your computer and a web server.


Simple Definitions

File Transfer: It is used to upload (send) or download (receive) files over the internet.

Bridge: It acts as the bridge between your local computer and the remote server where your website lives.

Management: Developers use it to manage website folders, like adding images or updating code.


How it Works

FTP Client: The software you use on your PC (e.g., FileZilla or WinSCP).

FTP Server: The computer where your website data is stored.

Login Details: You usually need a Host, Username, Password, and Port 21 to connect.


Common Examples

Uploading an index.html file to make a website go live.

Downloading a backup of your website files to your laptop.

Sending large video files that are too big for email.


Main Types

FTP: The basic version. It's fast but not secure (data is sent in plain text).

SFTP: Secure FTP. It encrypts your data so hackers can't see your password. This is what most people use today.

FTPS: FTP over SSL. Like HTTPS for websites, it uses security certificates to keep transfers private.
