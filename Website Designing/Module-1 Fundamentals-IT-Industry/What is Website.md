#What is a Website?
A Website is a collection of related webpages that are grouped together under a single domain name. It is hosted on a web server and can be accessed by anyone using a web browser and an internet connection.  
Simple Definitions
Digital Folder: Think of a website as a digital "book" and each webpage as a single "page" inside that book.  
Online Identity: It is the official "home" for a business, person, or organization on the internet.  
Collection: A website is made up of a Home Page plus multiple other Webpages (like About Us, Contact, or Services).
How it Works
URL: You access a website by typing its unique address (e.g., https://www.google.com).
Landing Page: Usually the first page you see when you open a website is called the Home Page or Landing Page.  
Navigation: You move between different pages of a website using Links or a Menu. 

Examples of Websites
Static Website: Simple sites where the content doesn't change much (e.g., a local business's "About Us" site).  
Dynamic Website: Sites that update automatically or allow user interaction (e.g., Flipkart, Amazon, or a MERN stack app).
