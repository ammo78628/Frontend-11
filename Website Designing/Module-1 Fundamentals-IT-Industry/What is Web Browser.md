#What is a Web Browser?
A Web Browser is a software application used to access and view websites on the internet. When you type a URL, the browser acts as a "translator" that turns website code into the images and text you see on your screen.
Simple Definitions
The Window: It’s your gateway to the World Wide Web (WWW).
The Translator: It takes complex code (HTML, CSS, JS) and renders it into a readable page.
The Client: In the "Client-Server" model, the browser is the Client that requests data from a Web Server.
How it Works
Request: You type a web address (URL).
Fetch: The browser asks the Web Server for the site's files.
Render: It puts the code together and displays the website.
Key Features
Address Bar: Where you type the URL.
Navigation: Back, Forward, and Refresh buttons.
History & Bookmarks: Tools to save and find sites you've visited.
Developer Tools: (Crucial for MERN stack!) A built-in toolkit to inspect code and debug errors.
