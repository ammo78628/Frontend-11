#What is a Web Server?
A Web Server is a computer that stores website files and "serves" them to users over the internet. When you type a URL in your browser, the web server is the machine that sends the data back to you.
Simple Definitions
The Librarian: It listens for requests from browsers and delivers the right "book" (webpage).
Hardware: A physical computer (usually in a data center) that stays on 24/7.
Software: Programs like Apache or Nginx that manage how files are sent to users.
How it Works
Request: You enter a URL (e.g., www.google.com).
Processing: The server finds the HTML, CSS, and image files for that page.
Response: The server sends those files back to your browser to display them.
Key Components
IP Address: Every server has a unique number so the internet knows where to find it.
HTTP/HTTPS: The "language" the server uses to talk to your browser.
Storage: Where your website’s code and database are kept.
