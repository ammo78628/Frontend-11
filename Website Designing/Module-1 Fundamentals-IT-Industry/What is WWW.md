The "Web": It is the "software" part of the internet—while the internet is the hardware (cables/routers), the WWW is the content.
Hyperlinks: It connects pages together through links so you can jump from one site to another.
How it Works

Web Browser: The tool you use to "see" the web (e.g., Chrome, Safari, or Edge).
HTML: The language used to create the pages that live on the WWW.
Key Components
