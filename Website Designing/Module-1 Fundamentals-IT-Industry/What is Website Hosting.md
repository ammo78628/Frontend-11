#What is Website Hosting?
​Website hosting is a service that provides the storage space on a server for your website’s files, making them accessible to anyone on the internet.
​Simple Definitions
​Digital Land: If your website is a "house," hosting is the land it sits on.
​Storage: It is a high-powered computer (server) that stays on 24/7 so your site never goes offline.
​Accessibility: When someone types your URL, the host sends your files to their browser.
​How it Works
​Server: A remote computer where all your images, code, and databases live.
​IP Address: Every host has a unique address that points to your files.
​Control Panel: Tools like cPanel or Plesk are used to manage the hosting.
